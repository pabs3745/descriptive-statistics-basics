Descriptive Statistics basics using the Real State California Database

## Objective
The organization wants to launch a marketing campaign targeting a specific audience. The department believes that after a brief analysis, marketing can be improved without investing additional resources.

## Example of the database


## Task 1
### Describing some data types

| Variable   | Type of Data  | Level of Measurement |
|------------|---------------|----------------------|
| CustId     | Categorical   | Nominal              |
| Mortage    | Categorical   | Nominal              |
| Year of sale | Numerical: discrete | Interval        |


## Task 2
### Frequency distribution

This information is biased, as the people who are included in the database is, usually, the one who signed the contract.

![histogram](histogram%20age.png)

![Age distribution](age%20distribution.png)

![cumulative](cumulative%20by%20state.png)

A possible scenario would be to invest in the top 80% of the locations. 

### Variability

![Stats](variability.png)

The Standard deviation is around 13 years, showing how disperse the data is.

![correlation](correlation.png)

![scatter](scatter.png)

The correlation coefficient is very low, showing these two variables move in opposite directions, hence, they do not have a relationship whatsoever.
